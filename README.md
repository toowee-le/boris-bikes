# Boris Bikes

## Project Aim
London's Boris Bikes (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome. Anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London.

The aim of the project is to imagine going back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes, and create a program that emulates all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on), required to make this dream a reality.
